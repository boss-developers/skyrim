Better Oblivion Sorting Software (BOSS) will re-order your mods to their correct positions, putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.

BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods such as FCOM and MMM, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there (estimated at about 25,000 for Oblivion) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for the relevant game is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.


[u]DOWNLOADS:[/u]

[url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6]Better Oblivion Sorting Software at Skyrim Nexus[/url]

BOSS is also available at [url=http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516]Better Oblivion Sorting Software at TES Nexus[/url], [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999]Fallout New Vegas Nexus[/url] and [url=http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193]Fallout 3 Nexus[/url]. All three sites have the same files.


[u]INSTALLATION AND USE:[/u]

[b]Note that BOSS does not support Windows 2000 or earlier.[/b]

1. If you have Wrye Bash, make sure the "Lock Times" function is deactivated.

2. If upgrading from an earlier version of BOSS, delete all BOSS files and folders in your game's Data folder (including the BOSS folder, BOSS.exe, masterlist.txt, modlist.txt, modlist.old, BOSSlog.txt and any of BOSS's .bat files). If you have an edited masterlist, make sure to keep a backup so that your edits are not lost. It is recommended that you instead use the userlist functionality to apply changes to the masterlist.

3. Extract the BOSS archive you downloaded to your game's installation directory (ie. the one containing the Data folder and TESV.exe, so "Skyrim", so that there is now a BOSS folder alongside the Data folder and TESV.exe.

4. In the BOSS folder, run the "BOSS.exe". This will download the latest masterlist from the Internet and then sort your mods.

5. Thereafter when running BOSS, you may run it directly from the BOSS.exe to simply update your masterlist then sort your mods, or you can use the GUI to choose how BOSS runs.

Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. Wrye Bash will automatically import and apply Bash Tag suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in Wrye Bash if necessary.

You will need to reorder unrecognised mods by hand using OBMM or Wrye Bash.


[u]UNINSTALLATION:[/u]

Delete the BOSS folder in your "skyrim" folder (ie. the one containing the Data folder and TESV.exe).


[u]CONTRIBUTIONS AND HELP:[/u]
1256118
General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised or unclean mods, takes place in BOSS's official threads for [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1205712]Oblivion[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1132338]Nehrim[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1256118]Skyrim[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1175276]Fallout 3[/url] and [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1203068]Fallout: New Vegas[/url].

User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.

Lists of unrecognized mods are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get: 
[list=1]
[*] The ESP/ESM file name(s) and 
[*] A link to where the description, download or readme can be found to read or download. 
[*] A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.
[/list]
Lists of unclean mods are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:
[list=1]
[*] The ESP/ESM file name(s).
[*] The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES4Edit (not the number of records processed).
[*] The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES4Edit (not the number of records processed).
[*] The CRC(s) of the unlcean ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the uncleaned files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, Wrye Bash or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the "CRC checksum for data" is the one required.
[/list]


[u]UPDATES:[/u]

You can check for updates to BOSS then download and install any available using the GUI's "Check For Updates" functionality. Masterlist updates are by default automatically downloaded by BOSS when it runs.

BOSS program updates are also published at the [url=http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516]TES Nexus[/url], [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6]Skyrim Nexus[/url], [url=http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193]Fallout 3 Nexus[/url] and [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999]New Vegas Nexus[/url] BOSS pages. For those not using the masterlist updater, the latest masterlist is always on the Google Code repository.

Always make sure to use the latest version of BOSS and the latest masterlist.


[u]CREDITS:[/u]

As BOSS is very much a community project, credit is due to a very large number of sources and people outside of the BOSS Team. Credit goes to the following:

For load order information:

[list]
[*] Agiel's Annotated Load Order.
[*] Fivefries load order.
[*] dev_akm's expanded FCOM load order.
[*] The Martigen's Monster Mod Team.
[*] The Better Cities developers.
[*] Many, many modders and users who have posted suggestions and instructions in the BOSS threads and on the Nexus sites.
[/list]
Some people have gone out of their way and provided continuing, expert and detailed help - thank you very much! In addition to the above, the following are credited with additional non-load-order-related support:

[list]
[*] Wrye and the rest of the Wrye Bash Team: For implementing the importing of BOSS's Bashed Patch tag suggestions and general support for BOSS into Wrye Bash.
[*] The Beta Testing & Analysis Guild at TESAlliance: For extensive testing and giving feedback on v1.6 prior to release.
[*] Surazal: For extensive testing and feedback during development of v1.6, and for providing the inspiration for many features through his BOSS Masterlist Manager macro for Microsoft Word.
[*] myk002: For extensive code contributions and testing during development of v1.6+.
[*] Hickory: For testing and feedback on v1.7+ prior to release, and providing the icon used by the BOSS and GUI executables.
[*] andalaybay: For testing and feedback on v1.7+ prior to release.
[*] Telyn: For testing and feedback on v1.8 prior to release.
[/list]

The BOSS programs are written in C/C++ and make use of the BOOST, libcurl, wxWidgets and UTF8-CPP libraries. Without them, the majority of BOSS's features would probably never have been implemented.
