BOSS (Better Oblivion Sorting Software) will re-order your mods to their correct positions, putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.

BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there (estimated at about 25,000 for Oblivion) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for the relevant game is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.


[size="5"]Downloads[/size]

BOSS can be downloaded from [url=http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516]TES Nexus[/url], [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6]Skyrim Nexus[/url], [url=http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193]Fallout 3 Nexus[/url] and [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999]Fallout New Vegas Nexus[/url]. All four sites have the same files.


[size="5"]Installation & Basic Usage[/size]

[b]Note that BOSS does not support Windows 2000 or earlier.[/b]

1. If you have Wrye Smash, make sure the "Lock Times" function is deactivated.

3. Extract the BOSS archive you downloaded to your game's installation directory (ie. the one containing the Data folder and TESV.exe, so "Skyrim", so that there is now a BOSS folder alongside the Data folder and TESV.exe.

4. In the BOSS folder, run the "BOSS.exe". This will download the latest masterlist from the Internet and then sort your mods.

5. Thereafter when running BOSS, you may run it directly from the BOSS.exe to simply update your masterlist then sort your mods, or you can use the GUI to choose how BOSS runs.

Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. Wrye Smash will automatically import and apply Bash Tag suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in Wrye Smash if necessary.

You will need to reorder unrecognised mods by hand using a mod manager of your choice (eg. Wrye Smash).


[size="5"]Contributions & Help[/size]

General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised or unclean mods, takes place in BOSS's official threads for [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1205712]Oblivion[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1132338]Nehrim[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1256118]Skyrim[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1175276]Fallout 3[/url] and [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1203068]Fallout: New Vegas[/url].

User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.

Lists of unrecognized mods are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:

[list]
[*] The ESP/ESM file name(s).
[*] A link to where the description, download or readme can be found to read or download.
[*] A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.
[/list]
Lists of unclean mods are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:

[list]
[*] The ESP/ESM file name(s).
[*] The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES5Edit (not the number of records processed).
[*] The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES5Edit (not the number of records processed).
[*] The CRC(s) of the unlcean ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the uncleaned files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, Wrye Smash or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the "CRC checksum for data" is the one required.

[size="5"]Updates[/size]

You can check for updates to BOSS then download and install any available using the GUI's "Check For Updates" functionality. Masterlist updates are by default automatically downloaded by BOSS when it runs.

BOSS program updates are also published at the [url=http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516]TES Nexus[/url], [url=http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6]Skyrim Nexus[/url], [url=http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193]Fallout 3 Nexus[/url] and [url=http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999]New Vegas Nexus[/url] BOSS pages. For those not using the masterlist updater, the latest masterlist is always on the Google Code repository.

Always make sure to use the latest version of BOSS and the latest masterlist.

Better Oblivion Sorting Software is distributed under the [url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html]GNU General Public License v3.0[/url], aside from the documentation, which is distributed under the [url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html]GNU Free Documentation License v1.3[/url]. The documents covered by the latter license are "BOSS ReadMe.html", "BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html", "BOSS API ReadMe.html" and "BOSS Masterlist Syntax.html".

For the full text of both licenses, see the included "GNU GPL v3.0.txt" and "GNU FDL v1.3.txt" files.

While the GPL license allows anyone to make derivative works of BOSS, the BOSS Development Team encourages those thinking of doing so to first discuss their reasoning for such an endevour with the Team. It may be that what the derivative work would do differently from BOSS itself is already planned for a future version of BOSS or would be happily integrated into BOSS by the Team, thus avoiding any extra effort by others.

The BOSS Team also appeals to the community to avoid the distribution and development of alternative masterlists, as this would only hamper the community effort to create one universally-optimised load order for all plugins available for download. Any issues with a masterlist are best brought to the attention of the BOSS Team so that we may remedy them ourselves.
